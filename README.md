Hi world!

This repository is related to the papers below:
1. Towards More Transparent and Accurate Cancer Diagnosis with an Unsupervised CAE Approach;
2. WWFedCBMIR: World-Wide Federated Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval;
3. Self-supervised learning of a tailored Convolutional Auto Encoder for histopathological prostate grading;
4. Residual block Convolutional Auto Encoder in Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval.

The main focus of this code is rebuilding histopathological images by extracting meaningful features of images.
In each of these papers, different configurations have been applied but the main workflow is reported in this repository.

This model receives images and tries to reconstruct images in the output.
As much as the output is similar to the input the extracted features contain more valuable information.
